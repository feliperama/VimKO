- add unit tests to leader t/T for php and javascript mocha or jest.
- problem when on php search with * is geting the - signal after some stuff
- fix folding on php (is on the slack channel)
- Createa search where I can define an aditional glob (to find on specific folders)
  * understand and refactore the searches if needed. The non gitignore sometimes is good,
    sometimes is crap. I think the ;G map is planned to use the gitignore
  * there is some maps that I NEVER use tbh although interesting

- feature: search the entire word selected on visual mode (\<word\>)
- Improve the replaces (or learn regex) for the following paterns:
 json
 object javascript
 new: array (hashset) php: =>

- Search where the first word is to be used to exclude dir? is that really
  usefull? maybe a list ignore stuff and process it e.g: ".php,.html,build/**"

- Feature: snippets
 * snippet for import inside test cases should already put by default the
   correct number of ../../../ (probably using some python for it)
