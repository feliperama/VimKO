- add unit tests to leader t/T for php and javascript mocha or jest.
- problem when on php search with * is geting the - signal after some stuff
- fix folding on php (is on the slack channel)
- Createa search where I can define an aditional glob (to find on specific folders)
  * understand and refactore the searches if needed. The non gitignore sometimes is good,
    sometimes is crap. I think the ;G map is planned to use the gitignore
  * there is some maps that I NEVER use tbh although interesting
